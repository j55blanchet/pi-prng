Notes:  
* pi200m.txt contains the first 10m digits of pi, divided into 10-digit segments  
* pi200m_new.txt contains the same as above, but with spaces and newlines removed  
* In order to run diehard tests successfully, we need to convert this file to binary or ASCII hex (then to binary using diehard's ASCII to binary converter)
